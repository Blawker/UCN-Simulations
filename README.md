# UCN-Simulations
Simulations of ultracold neutrons (UCN) using Kassiopeia particle tracking framework:
*https://github.com/KATRIN-Experiment/Kassiopeia*

## First project: Beamline
- Initialize the geometry of a beamline structure for UCN.
- Adding surface reflection for stainless steel.
- Generate initial energy spectrum according to TRIGA neutrons distribution[*](1).
- Adding binary program to create and add output file into Root's histograms.
- Adding Shell script to merge Root histograms and automate simulations and output writing.
